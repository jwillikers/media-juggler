Scripts to tag, convert, and upload my music, audiobooks, ebooks, and comics.

[NOTE]
====
This mostly a minimum-viable product right now, in need of a lot more work.
I've realized that MusicBrainz and BookBrainz are the best solutions for tagging Audiobooks, books, and comics.
Unfortunately, they aren't populated with a ton of metadata yet, so I'm working on adding as much metadata to them as I can right now.
I plan on coming back to improve these scripts after that.
====

== Usage

This repository provides a collection of scripts to make it easier to add various digital media to my collection.
This includes things like music, audiobooks, ebooks, and comics.
When purchasing media, it often needs to be renamed, converted, tagged with _correct_ information, losslessly optimized to reduce files size, and finally uploaded to the appropriate location on my media server.
The utilities here aim to automate this as much as possible.
Ultimately, the workflow should be as simple as downloading the media to the corresponding import directory on my computer.
There's quite a bit of initial set up that needs to be completed first, though, so that's where we'll begin.

Use this Nix flake in your Home Manager configuration to incorporate these scripts in your project.
Here's an example of how to incorporate this repository's flake as part of your project.

// todo link to my Home Manager config
. Add `media-juggler` to `flake.nix` and the provided Home Manager module to the `modules` of your configuration.
+
.flake.nix
[,nix]
----
{
  inputs = {
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
    home-manager = {
      url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
    media-juggler.url = "github:jwillikers/media-juggler";
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  };
  outputs =
    {
      self,
      flake-utils,
      media-juggler,
    }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (
      system:
      let
        pkgs = import nixpkgs {
          inherit system;
        };
      in
      {
        homeConfigurations.jdoe = home-manager.lib.homeManagerConfiguration {
          inherit pkgs;

          modules = [
            media-juggler.hmModules.media-juggler
          ];
        };
      }
    );
}
----

. Apply the updated Home Manager configuration.
+
[,sh]
----
home-manager --flake .#$(id --name --user)@$(hostname --short) switch
----

. Create an Adobe account in order to use https://www.adobe.com/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html[Adobe Digital Editions].
It is recommended to use a dedicated account for this in the event that the account is banned by Adobe.
Be sure to read the https://github.com/Leseratte10/acsm-calibre-plugin/tree/v0.0.16?tab=readme-ov-file#setup[Setup section of the README] for the Calibre ACSM Input plugin to understand all of the implications.
. Sign up for a Comic Vine account https://comicvine.gamespot.com/login-signup/[here].
. Get your Comic Vine API token from https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/[here].
This will be used later to configure some of the tools.

. Create an alias for your MinIO instance.
This allows you to configure your credentials to access this server.
+
[,sh]
----
mc alias set jwillikers https://minio.jwillikers.io
----

// todo
// . Add your Comic Vine API token to ComicTagger.
// +
// [,sh]
// ----
// comictagger --only-set-cv-key --cv-api-key <Comic Vine API key>
// ----

. Create the directory `~/.config/calibre/plugins/`.
+
[,sh]
----
mkdir --parents ~/.config/calibre/plugins/
----

. Add your Comic Vine API key to the Calibre Comic Vine plugin config file.
+
.~/.config/calibre/plugins/comicvine.json
[,json]
----
{
  "api_key": "<Comic Vine API key>",
  "max_volumes": 2,
  "requests_rate": 1,
  "worker_threads": 16
}
----

. Open Calibre.
+
[,sh]
----
setsid calibre &>/dev/null &
----

. Activate ADE for the DeACSM plugin.
To import a previously exported activation, go to menu:Preferences[Plugins > DeACSM > Customize plugin > Import existing activation backup (ZIP)].
For a new activation, go to menu:Preferences[Plugins > DeACSM > Customize plugin > Link to ADE account].
After a new activation export the activation using menu:Preferences[Plugins > DeACSM > Customize plugin > Export account activation data] and back up this file.

. Import the key from DeACSM to the DeDRM plugin.
Open menu:Preferences[Plugins > DeDRM > Customize plugin > Adobe Digital Editions ebooks] and hit the btn:[+] icon.
The key should automatically be added.

. Currently, requires ComicTagger AppImage to be downloaded.
+
[,sh]
----
curl --location --remote-name --output-dir ~/Downloads https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger/releases/download/1.6.0-beta.2/ComicTagger-x86_64.AppImage
chmod +x ~/Downloads/ComicTagger-x86_64.AppImage
----

// todo Document getting Audible activation bytes and setting environment variable AUDIBLE_ACTIVATION_BYTES
// todo Document getting and setting various api keys for Beets

. Now, the provided scripts can be run like so.
+
[,sh]
----
import-comics.nu ~/Downloads/ComicTagger-x86_64.AppImage file.acsm
----

=== Optimizations

I make use of several utilities to decrease file sizes.
I only optimize images, ebooks, and comics.
I don't really mess with audio although I have some experimental options for messing around with that.
Images are optimized with image_optim using its default settings followed by `efficient-compression-tool`, which can typically gain a small improvement for PNGs.
For comic book archives and EPUBs, this is easy enough as these are just ZIP archives of files.
I also optimize the ZIP archive compression with `efficient-compression-tool`.
For PDFs, I use `minuimus` and `pdfsizeopt`, with a couple tweaks to use `oxipng` with max settings followed by `efficient-compression-tool`.
This often leads to significant space savings for manga from Fanatical and Humble Bundle, usually 25-35%, but it takes a long time, like 16 hours for a 200 MiB PDF.

== Develop

The `nix develop` command can be used to enter or run commands in an environment with all of the necessary dependencies.
For convenience, direnv can be used to automatically load this environment when entering the project's directory.
The https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mkhl.direnv[mkhl.direnv VSCode extension] integrates this environment in VSCode for development.
Nix also generates the configuration for https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit], which automates formatting and various checks when committing changes.
Follow the instructions here to set up your development environment using Nix.

. Install an implementation of {Nix}, such as https://lix.systems[Lix] used here.
+
[,sh]
----
curl -sSf -L https://install.lix.systems/lix | sh -s -- install
----

. Clone this project's repository.
+
[,sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/jwillikers/media-juggler.git

cd media-juggler
----

. Install direnv for your system according to the https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html[direnv installation instructions].
+
[,sh]
----
sudo rpm-ostree install direnv
sudo systemctl reboot
----

. Integrate direnv with your shell by following the instructions on the https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html[direnv Setup page].

+
[,sh]
----
direnv allow
